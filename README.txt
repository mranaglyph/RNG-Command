If you would like to change some of the 
options/settings in RNG Command, 
go ahead and edit the config.txt file.
 
However, because of the way it is programmed, 
the config.txt file will need to be edited in particular ways.

It's probably best to open the config.txt file in notepad++
(Although not necessary)

All of the options in the config file can be changed, but
need to remain on the lines they are written - just don't space
things out or create newlines or anything.

The options should be pretty self-explanatory, 
but the config file MUST be in the same folder as
RNG Command, unlike the commandList.txt file.

Additionally, each new command you add to the commandList.txt file
needs to be added on a newline, but don't have any blank newlines
before or after the text, or you'll have blank commands.

The commandList file comes pre-loaded with commands for Dark Souls
(as this was the original intention), but since it has expanded, 
it can be customized to give a player commands for any game!

You just need to customize/create a new command list, which 
can be done inside the existing commandList.txt or some other 
file. Just be sure to change the config.txt settings to 
reflect any changes to the command list file name/location.

That's it! 
When you're done changing the settings to your liking, 
just run the RNG Command.exe.
 
Alternatively, if you have Autoit, you can open/run the 
source code in the .au3 file. 

Either way, Enjoy!
And of course, if you fail any of the commands, 
the punishment is up to you to decide.

P.S. 
The app already shows this in the command messages, but
you close the app with F9. 
Also, I make no promises about this app working on anything 
other than Windows, and even then, there may/may not be some 
niche exceptions.
